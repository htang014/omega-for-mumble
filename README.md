# omega-for-mumble

##### This is a fork of donzooles' Omega skin I modified several years ago.  Since the original project appears to be abandoned, I'm going to push my changes into my own fork's master.  Feel free to download.

##### Dark theme is fully functional and I don't think that will change.  Light theme is untested.

**omega-for-mumble** is a simple & beautified skin / theme designed for the open-source and high quality voice-chat software **[mumble](http://wiki.mumble.info/wiki/Main_Page)**. The project is open – anyone can help to improve it.
